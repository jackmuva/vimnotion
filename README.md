## Granular Todos
1. `enter` and `-` in sidebar editor
2. lcs to detech changes in sidebar buffer

## High-level Todos
- search experience
  - sqlite with full-text search, indexed db with incremental sync
  - in sqlite, keep a json string with directory structure;
  this will work as we can search by name client-side and search grep server-side/indexed-db
- markdown renderer
  - ability to link pages, insert images, embed videos
  - how do we keep images private (to research)
- normie view (not vimnotion)
- create teams
- extensabiity with hotkeys for apis
- router for vimnotion versions
- version history
  - trash
- local md downloads
